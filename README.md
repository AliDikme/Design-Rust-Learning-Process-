# Design-Rust-Learning-Process

In this comprehensive report, we will delve into the world of a programming language named 
Rust. Rust is gaining attention in the technology community for its unique qualities, its safety 
and efficiency. This growing interest makes Rust an important subject for us to explore and 
understand. Our primary objective for first senior design is to gain a deeper understanding of 
Rust and to examine its practical applications in various projects.
We will begin our exploration by introducing Rust. We will explain what Rust is, its key 
features, and why it is becoming a language of choice for many programmers. This 
introduction to Rust aims to provide a clear and simple understanding of the languageâ€™s 
basics.
Following the introduction, we will compare Rust with another well-known programming 
language, C. This comparison is crucial as it will help us understand the advantages and 
differences of Rust in contrast to other languages. We will focus on simple and 
easy-to-understand examples to make this comparison clear and informative.
In our report, we have included practical examples of projects developed in Rust. Specifically, 
we will look at two different versions of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. One version uses a method 
known as shared memory, while the other employs message passing for communication 
between different parts of the program. These projects are not just for illustration; they are 
pivotal in helping us grasp how Rust works in real-world applications.
Lastly, we will look towards the future and discuss our plans for using Rust. We are 
particularly excited about the prospect of creating our own small, specialized language using 
Rust. This ambitious project, while challenging, promises significant learning experience.
In conclusion, our journey through this report will take us from the basic principles of Rust to 
its practical applications and future potential
